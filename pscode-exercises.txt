
// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers


1 take variablers of a, b, and sum
2 read variablesd into a, b
3 add the variables a, b to get sum
4 give the sum result

(a + b == sum(print))

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

(Your pseudocode here)
 if Number % by 2!= 0 Print Odd
 if Number divided by 2 = 0 Print even 

If N/2!= 0 "prinnt odd"
If N/2== 0 "print even"

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

a. a==N(1), b==N(2), c==N(3) d==N(4), e==N(5)
b. :==Average W==of : W abcd== "Print"3
c. Sm== smallest minimum, Lm== largest minimum
Sm W abcde ==a  Lm W abcde ==e
d.:==average W==of Sm==smallest minimum Lm== largest minimum
